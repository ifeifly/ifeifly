- ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️ What is faith?
I don't know what faith is. Therefore, I checked Baidu Encyclopedia. There are two explanations:

1. Belief refers to the belief and admiration of a certain thought or religion and someone or something, and regard it as their own code of conduct. Faith has the color of rational subjective and emotional experience, especially in religious belief, and even loses reason.

2. Belief defined by philosophers: "a strong belief is usually manifested in stubborn trust in things that lack sufficient evidence and cannot convince every rational person."

Although I can understand the meaning of the above words, I can't know what it's like to have faith.

When I was at school, I thought that people with religious beliefs could talk about faith. Later, I learned that the party is also a kind of faith, and all kinds of beliefs are mutually exclusive, that is, it is unique. You can only believe one kind, not many kinds - this is not difficult to understand. After all, it is something with emotional experience and may make you lose your mind, It certainly has a unique position.

From a religious point of view, I have no faith; From a partisan point of view, neither do I. In nearly 30 years of life, I have never considered what my faith is. I don't understand what role "faith" plays in one's life. I can only slowly understand it through other ways.
